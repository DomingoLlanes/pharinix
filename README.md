# pharinix

Installation:

You must copy the files to your local server for access by http://localhost/pharinix
Load the file "files/pharinix alfa YYYYMMDD HHII.sql" to your database.
Configure MySQL connection in etc/pharinix.config.php.

Then you can view the CMS running.

Information:

This is a alpha version and it must grow, it is lacks of options and functions. It don't have users, groups, security, hocks, etc... All of it will come soon.

The background concept it's the use of minimalist commands, bits of code, that we can reuse easy with minimal footprint in resources. The source code have some comments, I recommed read it.
